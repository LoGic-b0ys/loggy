# Loggy, Log Your Favourite

## Overview

Just my personal project to keep track my favourite and watched movie with mysql database.

## Motivation

I have tracked my favourite book, movie, and music with OneNote before, and I think it's not effective and require so much organizing page. It's still feel difficult to search movie and sort it with one note, so I make this.

## Installation

1. You have to install web server, PHP, and MySQL to use this. You can install it online or offline
2. Clone this to your htdocs folder
3. Change your configuration (e.g hostname, db user etc.) in application/config/db_config.php
4. Create new database based your configuration
5. Import loggy.sql to your database
6. Enjoy loggy with initial username : admin, password : admin
